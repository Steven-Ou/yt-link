About The Project
YT Link provides a clean, easy-to-use interface for downloading audio from YouTube. Whether you need a single track or an entire playlist, this application streamlines the process, delivering high-quality MP3 files directly to your computer.

Key Features
Single Video to MP3: Quickly convert any YouTube video into a high-quality MP3 file.

Playlist to ZIP: Download an entire playlist as a conveniently packaged ZIP archive of MP3s.

Combine Playlist: Merge all tracks from a playlist into a single, continuous MP3 file.

Cross-Platform: Native builds available for both Windows and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).

Installation and Usage
To get started, simply download the correct version for your operating system from the latest release.

For Windows Users
Go to the Releases page.

Download the latest YT-Link-Windows-x64.zip file.

Important: Once downloaded, right-click the .zip file and select "Extract All...". Choose a location to extract the files.

Open the newly extracted folder and run YT Link.exe to start the application.

For macOS Users
Go to the Releases page.

Download the latest .dmg file for your Mac's architecture (e.g., YT-Link-macOS-arm64.dmg for Apple Silicon or YT-Link-macOS-x64.dmg for Intel).

Open the downloaded .dmg file. A new window will appear.

Drag the YT Link application icon into the Applications folder shortcut.

You can now launch the app from your Applications folder.

Important Note for macOS Users:

The first time you open the app, you may see a warning because it is not from an identified developer.

Method 1 (Recommended): Right-click the app icon and select "Open" from the context menu. You may need to do this twice.

Method 2 (If the app "is damaged"): If you see an error message saying the app is damaged and can’t be opened, you will need to run the following command in your Terminal. This command removes the quarantine attribute that causes the error.

sudo xattr -cr "/Applications/YT Link.app"

You will be prompted to enter your password. After running the command, you should be able to open the app normally.
