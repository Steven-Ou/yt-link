For Windows Users
Go to the Releases page.

Open the newly extracted folder and run YT Link.exe to start the application.

For macOS Users
Go to the Releases page.

Download the latest .dmg file for your Mac's architecture (e.g., YT-Link-macOS-arm64.dmg for Apple Silicon or YT-Link-macOS-x64.dmg for Intel).

Open the downloaded .dmg file. A new window will appear.

Drag the YT Link application icon into the Applications folder shortcut.

You can now launch the app from your Applications folder.

Important Note for macOS Users:

The first time you open the app, you may see a warning because it is not from an identified developer.

Method 1 (Recommended): Right-click the app icon and select "Open" from the context menu. You may need to do this twice.

Method 2 (If the app "is damaged"): If you see an error message saying the app is damaged and canâ€™t be opened, you will need to run the following command in your Terminal. This command removes the quarantine attribute that causes the error.

sudo xattr -cr /Applications/YT Link.app

You will be prompted to enter your password. After running the command, you should be able to open the app normally.
